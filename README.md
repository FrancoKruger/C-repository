### TODO ###
Implement the following and add to REPO:

Basic Topics:
File I/O: Read numbers from a text file and find their average. Write the average to a new text file.
Data Structures: Implement a stack using arrays. Push and pop elements and display the stack status after each operation.
Intermediate Topics:
Pointer Arithmetic: Demonstrate the use of pointer arithmetic to traverse an array of integers and find the sum.
Structs: Create a struct to represent a complex number and implement basic operations like addition and multiplication.
Dynamic Memory: Allocate a 2D array dynamically using malloc or calloc and perform matrix multiplication.
String Manipulation: Write a program that takes a string and returns the string with every vowel replaced by its uppercase counterpart.
Advanced Topics:
Bit Manipulation: Implement a program that takes an integer and finds the position of the rightmost set bit.
Linked Lists: Implement a doubly linked list and demonstrate insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Function Pointers: Implement a menu-driven program that uses function pointers to call different mathematical operations (like addition, subtraction, etc.).
Hash Table: Implement a hash table with separate chaining to store key-value pairs. Perform operations like insert, delete, and search.
Highly Challenging:
Multi-File Program: Write a multi-file program where each file corresponds to different functionalities like sorting, searching, etc. Use Makefile for compilation.
Command Line Utility: Create a basic command-line utility that mimics a simplified version of grep, which searches for a given string in a file and returns the lines where it appears.
Custom Memory Allocator: Implement a simplified version of malloc and free functions using system calls like sbrk.
Use of setjmp and longjmp: Create a program that uses these functions to handle errors and jump between different parts of the code.
